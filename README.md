# Sum-of-Three-Algorithm
<p>This is a Algorithm Where all combinations of 3 numbers from a list of numbers, ranging -50 to +50 (in multiples of 5), is to added together to give a sum of 0.
The output will be the number of combinations that gave a sum of 0.</p>
<br>

<i>Note: The <b>"SumOfThree.py"</b> Python file is there to help you easily generate a number list, of any length (between -50 and 50 in multiples of 5)
, and write it to a text file.</i>

<ol>
  <li>
  <h3>SumOfThree</h3>
  <p>This is a program where the number list is <b>loaded from a text file</b> "SumOfThree.txt" to an <b>ArrayList</b> and the Sum of three Algorithms is run upon them</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
  <h3>SumOfThree_v2</h3>
  <p>This is a program where the number list is <b>loaded from a text file</b> "SumOfThree.txt" to an ArrayList, where the <b>ArrayList is then converted to an Array</b>, and the Sum of three Algorithms is run upon them</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
  <h3>SumOfThree_v3</h3>
  <p>In this case the numbers are <b>hard-coded into a Array</b> at the beginning itself, and so it uses this array to Sum of Three Algorithm</p>
